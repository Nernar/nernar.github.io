# Better Foliage

Better Foliage — a mod-library that will make your Minecraft worlds more impressive, mainly by improving how vegetation looks. Latest up-to-date version of library is available for download in [mods browser](https://icmods.mineprogramming.org/mod?id=683).

This is port for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, working under Inner Core for Horizon. At the current moment this is alpha version, that contains only core features of the original mod.

## Adding Custom Leaves

To integrate better foliage with your mod, you need 2 things: generate leaves textures and setup render for leaves block.

To make preloader generate leaves textures, create file with extension *.rescfg* in your resources and add all leaves textures:

```js
{
    "better-foliage": {
        "leaves": [
            { "texture": "terrain-atlas/texture1.png" },
            ...
        ]
    }
}
```

Next, use follwing code to register render for leaves block:

```js
ModAPI.addAPICallback("BetterFoliageLeaves", function(BetterFoliage) {
    BetterFoliage.setupLeavesModel(block id, data or -1, ["block texture name", block texture index]);
});
```

If your leaves use vanilla leaves color source, you may pass additional parameter, that specifies vanilla leaves type to get color from:

```js
ModAPI.addAPICallback("BetterFoliageLeaves", function(BetterFoliage) {
    // vanilla leaves data:
    // 0 - oak
    // 1 - spruce 
    // 2 - birch
    // 3 - jungle
    BetterFoliage.setupLeavesModel(block id, data or -1, ["block texture name", block texture index], vanilla leaves data);
});
```
